DailyHot - Trending Aggregation Platform

DailyHot (今日热榜) is a platform that aggregates trending headlines from major websites, aiming to provide users with a simple and efficient solution for tracking internet-wide hot topics. The platform consists of two parts: a backend that offers APIs for aggregating trending content and a frontend that displays an intuitive ranking interface[1].

Key Features
Cross-Platform Content Aggregation

Aggregates trending content from multiple popular websites, enabling users to grasp trending topics across the internet without visiting individual platforms.

Multi-Source Support

Supports content from platforms like 51CTO. Users can access specific platform data via URLs (e.g., http://Synology_IP:6688/51cto)[1].

RSS Subscription

Users can append ?rss=true to URLs to retrieve data in RSS format for easy subscription in RSS readers[1].

Clean and Intuitive Interface

A minimalist frontend design with clear categorization for quick browsing.

Technical Highlights
High-Performance APIs

Backend APIs prioritize speed and responsiveness, facilitating seamless integration for developers[1].

Flexible Deployment

Supports multiple deployment methods, including Docker containerization, allowing self-hosting on NAS devices like Synology[1].

Environment Variable Configuration

Configurable parameters (e.g., API endpoints, ICP备案 info) via environment variables[1].

Decoupled Architecture

Frontend and backend are decoupled: the frontend can be deployed serverlessly via Vercel, while the backend is provided as a Docker image[1].

User Experience
Cross-Device Compatibility

Responsive design ensures optimal display on both mobile and desktop devices[1].

Deployment Options
For self-hosting, DailyHot provides comprehensive guides:

Backend Deployment

Rapidly deploy the API using the Docker image imsyy/dailyhot-api[1].

Frontend Deployment

While no official frontend image is provided, users can deploy via Vercel or customize a Dockerfile based on project documentation[1].

Docker Compose One-Click Deployment

A sample docker-compose.yml file simplifies full-stack deployment[1].

As an open-source project hosted on GitHub, DailyHot allows developers to extend or modify its functionality. For users seeking to stay informed about trending topics without algorithmic interference, DailyHot delivers a streamlined and efficient solution[1].
